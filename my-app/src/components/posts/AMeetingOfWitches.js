                    The winds swirled up the sides of the tower, smoothly traversing the crystalline structure with its
                    uneven and angular protrusions. Even magically carved crystal is rather difficult to get perfectly
                    smooth and the tower, standing just over seven stories tall was a sight to behold and a feat of
                    magic to behold. The gust politely rushed past the penultimate window rattling the open frame
                    softly, like an expected knock at a door.
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Well Byrach how’s this current batch of students turning out?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    The words floated through the room, a bit of a prodding hello to the formerly sole occupant of the
                    space. Soft finger tips dusted the wearers outfit, a high necked jumpsuit cut to hug the owner’s
                    narrow waist and wide hips before becoming a pair of billowing legs with open slits along the sides.
                    The fabric, fine silk the color of the night sky, which, as the dust puffed off with each pat,
                    caught the sunlight coming through the window and caused it to appear as if it was stardust
                    scattered across the void of space.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As the words landed, and, before allowing a response the new arrival added &quot;you really must
                    clean your windowsill more often. Look at all the dust it got on me.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;You know you could always come in the door instead of the window?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Well, yes, but old habits die hard or never. If the students back in my day knew I was here
                    there’d be a line down the stairwell at least 3 stories. I’m more surprised you haven’t felt the
                    need to hide your comings and goings in all this time..&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Tajret,&quot; the original occupant pondered allowed &quot;is it, by any chance, possible that
                    maybe your lessons were a bit challenging, lacking in clear direction, or just a bit hand wavy at
                    times?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Well, Byrach, you turned out fine and didn’t pester me too much along the way.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    The two looked at one another. Each raising an eyebrow skeptically before bursting into laughter.
                    Byrach, with her full throated &quot;hehehe&quot;, leaning back in her chair while Tajret giggled,
                    hand over her mouth, emitting a high and heady &quot;teheehee&quot;. If any stranger had been
                    present in this moment it would have looked like two old friends telling an inside joke.
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Well, what exactly does bring you here&quot; Byrach questioned, standing and adjusting her
                    long brown skirt and tucked in white blouse. &quot;I would have assumed mother had you busy looking
                    into whatever trouble Xyxis was looking to cook up. Especially after what’s been happening
                    lately.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;The lady of luck has been busy and mother is well aware but she also determined we have no
                    place to interfere yet.&quot; Tajret moved to embrace her sister and pupil whispering into Byrach’s
                    ear &quot;The horrors are moving but their plans still remain beyond sight for even
                    Denor.&quot; Pulling back Tajret placed her hands on Byrach’s face, a gentle action of a mother
                    holder her daughter, and, locking eyes said with a sorrowful note &quot;what can we witches do if
                    the god of fate themselves hasn’t the cloudiest idea what those from beyond the stars are up
                    to.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;That’s it? Sit back, wait, see what happens?&quot; The quiet pleasantries of friendship were
                    no longer present as Byrach below and tore away from Tajret’s golden ring adorned
                    fingers. &quot;Have you lost all your empathy or have you simply forgotten your mortal time? I know
                    it’s been almost 300 years for me but I still hold that time close. They have no idea what might be
                    coming! We have to help them Tajret.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;No, my child&quot; her voice tightening, &quot;no, my pupil.&quot; The title wrapped around
                    Byrach like a snake constricting around its pray. &quot;You are still to young. This is far from the
                    first time that this has happened and it will not be the last. It is not our place for many reasons
                    not the least of which that our mother has said as much and that Ballate is responsible for
                    maintaining the protection of this world from those beyond.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    Byrach’s furry boiled turning her cheeks to a rosy tone. She felt the passion of Oreanyx welled
                    within her but before she could consider the right means of channeling it Tajret had acted. The
                    elegant golden rapped hands had already lifted through the air, tracing intricate patterns. Tajret
                    snapped her fingers and the room reverberated,the door and windows slamming shut and magically
                    sealing. Byrach recognized the working instantly, it was one of the spells she’d learned from
                    Tajret, who, with a twist of her wrist chilled the room coating it in frost. Byrach exhaled her
                    shoulders falling.
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Child, calm yourself. Learn the lesson of your mother who has served her role for a millennia
                    before you even breathed your first breath. You are the witch of knowledge. Your duty to all of us
                    is simple. Teach. Learn. We may not be able to meaningfully take a step yet you may yet have impact.
                    One your students is already woven into the events that shall transpire. Give her, and each of them,
                    what tools you can to rise to the challenge. Denor has chosen those who are meant to play the role
                    of fated actor. Nyxis will grant them the chance to succeed. You shall arm those who will help them
                    for that is our place as outsiders.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    The words hung heavy as the air began to warm and the frost started to evaporate from each
                    horizontal surface in the room. Tajrets yellow-brown eyes, infused with the yellow of their mother’s
                    own, were piercing as they bore down on Byrach.
                    <br/><br/>
                    When was the last time those eyes glared so intensely at Byrach? When last did they make her
                    question herself so completely?
                    <br/><br/>
                    — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
                    <br/><br/>
                    A knock resounded on the 6th story of Akkelare’s great tower. &quot;Mother&quot; a soft elderly
                    voice called out, muffled by the wood, &quot;I just noticed Resha flying away. Has something
                    happened.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    Tajret opened the door and looked at her pupil, Byrach. The woman’s white hair was in a bun leaving
                    her soft, wrinkled, questioning face fully visible. &quot;Yes. Come in. Sit.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    Byrach walked slowly taking the chair offered to her as Tajret collected a tome from a shelf across
                    the room and took a seat on the desk next to her student.
                    &quot;How old are you now Byrach? It must be somewhere around 80?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Yes mother. 82 tomorrow actually. It’s been, just about 71 years since you took me in.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Indeed&quot; Tajret flipped through the pages &quot;pulled you out of that nasty storm in the
                    kingdom of Eldeseen&quot; she stopped and looked up in thought, &quot;or should I say former. Did
                    you ever get that research finishes on the source?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;No mother. Though I have been calling it a necro-storm. It seems that something created an
                    imbalance that resulted in a huge influx of necrotic energy. Due to some atmospheric effect I
                    believe the energy became infused with the intense rain that traditionally falls between Lista and
                    Para.&quot;
                    Tajret raised an eyebrow &quot;You’ve made some break throughs it seems?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Yes mother. It took about 50 years but the experiment to cause necrotic magic to appear in
                    reaction to life granting magic was successful. It does seem that indeed at least these magic
                    energies attempt to maintain a balance.&quot; Byrach smiled at her teacher and said with a forlorn
                    tone &quot;I do hope someone will be able to complete this work one day.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Come now daughter, why now you?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;I... I don’t believe I have the time left for such efforts&quot; Byrach stammered in surprise.
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Well, what if it isn’t?&quot; Tajret stood and held Byrach’s face in her hands for a moment
                    before turning and beginning to pace. &quot;Coming back to your question at the door. Resha has
                    decide her time is over&quot; continuing over her student’s audible gasp she announced &quot;and she
                    came to inform me that, in addition, she has selected me to bear her mantle. A request I have
                    accepted.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;That is such wonderful news! I’m so glad I will be alive to celebrate this moment.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Oh Byrach, thank you. You are too kind. It is why I also must ask something of you.&quot; The
                    implication was clear and Byrach straighten up, nodding for Tajret who had given her daughter a
                    moment to compose herself. &quot;Your trial as a child granted to you access to magic at a young age
                    few ever achieve. You have studied under me for your mortal life and shown fine skill like no
                    student ever has in my 700 years teaching. Byrach, as my greatest pupil will you become my eternal
                    daughter and bear my mantle as the witch of knowledge?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
                    <br/><br/>
                    The door creaked open and the young woman entered surveying the room. &quot;The top tower of
                    Akkelare, appropriate&quot; she thought to herself. Her yellow eyes paused on each of the seven
                    women standing across from her. &quot;Daughters.&quot; The word rang out simple and commanding. A
                    hello from someone truly superior and especially odd from the form of a girl barely twenty years
                    old. She walked towards them, the lacy train of her black dress barely audible as it dragged across
                    the floor. Her white hair, falling to her mid-back, stood out against the black dress cut to knee
                    length in the front with it’s tight sleeves that billowed just before the hands, and showed collar
                    bone and shoulders. All seven woman bowed but one didn’t respond with &quot;mother&quot; as the
                    other’s did. &quot;Ah, that must be Byrach&quot; Baba Yaga thought to herself approaching Resha,
                    Tajret, and her soon-to-be daughter. &quot;Shall we begin?&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Resha, come forward.&quot; The woman dressed in a deep blue like the coldest parts of the
                    ocean stepped forward. &quot;You have served well and far longer than was necessary. I thank you for
                    all you have done my daughter. Your work has earned Denor’s respect. The millennia of effort has
                    shown him we are partners worthy of trust, an outcome that will likely have impacts for a millennia
                    or more to come.&quot; Baba Yaga leaned in and kissed Resha’s forehead before embracing her and
                    whispering &quot;you have my blessing, my love, and my thanks. You may rest.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    With a smile and a nod Resha began to weave the sacred spell that Baba Yaga had granted her. A spell
                    that wove a mantle of magic, a fragment of Baba Yaga’s own power, and, in doing so would unravel
                    Resha. A sacrifice, a freeing, a creation. All this and move tied together in the elegant spell Baba
                    Yaga and her remaining daughters, and grand-daughter, beheld.
                    <br/><br/>
                    When complete Baba Yaga dried her eye on her lace sleeves before announcing &quot;Tajret.&quot; As
                    her daughter stepped forward the pale hand with its sleeves chasing after them scooped the mantle, a
                    glowing orb of power from the air. &quot;Tajret, as the daughter of Resha and her selection to bear
                    her mantle. Tell me what you desire.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    Baba Yaga already knew. Tajret would accept the mantle of secrets. In doing so she would no longer
                    hold the mantle of knowledge. The only real question, would Byrach accept it. It wouldn’t be the
                    first time a mortal fled after seeing this ritual. It was rather striking after all. Watching
                    someone unweave their soul was unheard of in this world after all. At least not elegantly. Those
                    liches do some atrocious version but it’s so badly executed and the results are disguising undeath
                    with a barely tethered soul. If they were competent they’d be free to travel the stars themselves at
                    Resha was likely already doing. Her mind wandered through all this as she finished Tajret’s ceremony
                    and, having come to grasp the mantle of knowledge, given a physical form in this moment, she
                    gestured towards Byrach with her free hand. &quot;Come forward.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    The elderly figure approached Baba Yaga who hid her horror as Byrach took to her knees, struggling
                    in the process before responding &quot;Yes grandmother. I head your call.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;What a good girl&quot; Baba Yaga thought, resisting the urge to break her serious
                    composure. &quot;Byrach, daughter of my daughter. You stand before your aunts and mother and before
                    your grandmother on this day. You have studied for your natural life, you have proven your strength
                    of heart and mind and overcome great hardship to become worthy. So much so that your mother, Tajret,
                    once of knowledge, now of secrets, would select you to stand as her daughter eternal. I seek your
                    consent to take this power, to name yourself a great witch, a daughter of Baba Yaga, an eternal
                    force to maintain the order set forth by the Baba Yaga, three as one, to bear the mantle of
                    knowledge as your mother has.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    The kneeing form responded, raising her bowed head, strong green eyes connecting with Baba Yaga’s
                    own, &quot;great mother of Witches, Baba Yaga, it honors me be considered Tajret’s child would honor
                    me in kind to call myself your own. For however long. A decade, millennia, or longer. I shall honor
                    you, her, my aunts, and all those who have come before and after me in bearing the title of a
                    daughter of Baba Yaga.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    Baba Yaga stepped forward, and, placing a hand gently under Byrach’s chin, smiled down at
                    her. &quot;By my right I name you Byrach of Knowledge&quot; and, lowering to a knee and leaning in
                    Baba Yaga whispered &quot;this may be a lot.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
                    <br/><br/>
                    The two woman sat on the crystalline roof of Akkelare Academy’s tower reminiscing and passing a
                    bottle of fine bottle of Jorum back and forth, the distilled sea serpent poison had a phenomenal
                    floral note to it though it put most mortals on their asses at the slightest taste. &quot;Byrach you
                    were out for a week when mother gave you my old mantle. You were such a mess when you woke
                    up&quot; Tajret cried out gesticulating and taking the bottle from Byrach.
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;You couldn’t have been much better off when you first took it on.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;You’ll never know!&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Maybe I should visit Aunty Vivot and ask.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;You wouldn’t dare!&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    The two laughed and drank late into the evening. The clear, cloudless night sky slowly brightening
                    as the pale light of the moon rose over the horizon. Stars on one end of the sky and moon on the
                    other.

                    &quot;Tajret. When will we act.
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;I don’t know Byrach. Mother is incomprehensible even after all these centuries. Before Resha
                    left us she told me she couldn’t even begin to understand the true nature of our mother even after
                    her millennia and the millennia of those that came before her. The essence of her soul and those
                    before from the mantle tell me nothing the true nature of Baba Yaga.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    Byrach, standing and taking the last dregs of the liquor, couldn’t resist &quot;I won’t stand by
                    forever. Here me mother of mothers!&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;Stop it, you’ll wake your students Byrach.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    &quot;No, I’m serious. I won’t break out coven but I’ll do everything in my power. If my student
                    isn’t enough maybe it’s time for the ways of Akkelare to change.&quot;
                    <br/><br/>
                    Tajret looked up at her daughter, survivor of the necrostorm, last of the people of the lost kingdom
                    of Eldeseen, and Witch of Knowledge. She was a great sorceress long before she became a witch. She
                    had process even as Tajret attempted to keep magic from her. Maybe, just maybe, Byrach was right.
                    Tajret rolled onto her back and watched the stars as they faded and whispered to them, just quiet
                    enough for Byrach to not hear, &quot;I wonder what Denor and mother will have to say about
                    that.&quot;
