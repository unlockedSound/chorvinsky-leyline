                                    &quot;I don't know what to tell you&quot; the gruff voice moans with
                                    annoyance &quot;the
                                    mist comes in and I stay inside doing my job.&quot; Elroy lifts his forehead from an
                                    open palm hand shaking it softly and looks at his guest quizzically pondering
                                    aloud &quot;why would you want to know about the mist anyways? It's just mist.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Oh come now Honey, they are only being inquisitive&quot; a voice calls out
                                    with a
                                    touch of sweet mockery only to be followed by the man's wife entering with a pot of
                                    tea
                                    and two cups. “Elroy can be a bit grumpy when he knows a storm is coming in. Don’t
                                    mind
                                    it, he's sweet in the center.&quot; She winks at the guest and gives Elroy a little
                                    peck
                                    before whispering &quot;already put the honey in your cup&quot; and exiting with a
                                    coy
                                    giggle. Elroy looks back only catching a glimpse of Janet before she vanishes around
                                    the
                                    corner. He sighs heavily before pouring himself and his guest the tea. Taking a long
                                    sip
                                    he looks across the table &quot;tell me again Croemartee what's your interest in the
                                    mists.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The gentleman reaches down and with a long pale fingers delicately lifts the tea cup
                                    to
                                    take a sip. He smiles and with a voice that carries an air of scholarly training
                                    answers &quot;I've been studying historical records and believe these mists to be”
                                    he
                                    lapses for a moment looking for the right word before finishing with “too
                                    consistent.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Alright, but what does that mean?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;I do not know but I'd like to. It's why I'm here after all&quot; Croemartee
                                    says
                                    raising and spreading his hands in front of him like a blooming flower hiding a
                                    secret
                                    within. His fine robe's sleeves brush the table as he moves almost knocking over the
                                    tea
                                    cup. Elroy finds it odd that a robe of such fine material, with decorative
                                    embroidery
                                    along the seams too, would be so oversized but his guests frame is so slight that
                                    the
                                    robe still looks as it it will swallow him whole like a dragon turtle to a sailor
                                    caught
                                    in its maw.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Well lad here's what I can say. I'd never come or go during the fog. Too
                                    dangerous
                                    first off. Can't see if and where the waters come in. Go for a walk and might end up
                                    swept away. After all, the land between here and the mainland isn't big, you know it
                                    yourself having walked here, but give it some hours and parts of it will start to
                                    vanish
                                    as the tides change. For that matter I wouldn't leave even if it was safe
                                    because&quot; he puffs up his chest as if preparing to below a grand exultation only
                                    to
                                    be cut off by Janet, again from the kitchen &quot;because you’re the fourth
                                    generation
                                    lighthouse keeper, right Honey?&quot; She peeks around the corner flashing a smile
                                    and
                                    finishing &quot;It's your duty after all to make sure that all ships make it safely
                                    into
                                    the harbor of Alcern! If it wasn't for this lighthouse how could the great merchants
                                    of
                                    this fair city ever hope to do business.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Yes, Sweetheart, that is, indeed, what I was going to say&quot; he lets out
                                    with a
                                    bit of exasperation again watching Janet disappear back to her sizzling pans just
                                    barely
                                    audible from the table. &quot;With that all said, I've had folks leave here, only
                                    two
                                    mind you, one when I was a mere child and once when I when I was a young man.
                                    Neither
                                    made it back to the mainland. My father said that they both must have been hit by a
                                    wave
                                    and swept away. Beyond that I've heard that a half dozen or so have tried to reach
                                    the
                                    lighthouse when the mists are out and also gone missing but that's more a story to
                                    scare
                                    children than fact by any account I've been able to find.&quot;
                                    Croemartee drums his fingers softness as he watches the smile change to that
                                    pondering
                                    smile creeping across his face as Elroy goes on with his account. He waits a moment,
                                    letting Elroy shift uncomfortably in the near silence, broken by the sound of a
                                    boiling
                                    pot of water that has just joined the orchestra of kitchen work in the
                                    background. &quot;So things go missing in the mist. Seems normal by all accounts and
                                    rather logical given the tidal patterns that have been recorded to accompany them.”
                                    Croemartee’s fingers stop and, lifting his hands tighter, leans forward a bit. “So
                                    things go missing, but you haven't mentioned if anything ever comes
                                    out.&quot; Elroy's
                                    complexion shifts from its usual politely red tone to something more in line with
                                    the
                                    pale complexion Croemartee wears. Elroy watches his guest’s smile twists up at the
                                    corners and wonders if their eyes, like those of the orange cat that wanders the
                                    island,
                                    will narrow, as the feline’s do in the moment when prey comes into sight. &quot;Come
                                    now, Elroy” Croemartee continues making the implied question a reality. “What has
                                    the
                                    mist given us?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Elroy lifts himself warily and steps around his guest to a large trunk in the
                                    corner.
                                    Well cared for, the old studded leather appears finely crafted. “It was clearly well
                                    loved and taken care of over what must have been at least a few generations. Oh and
                                    well
                                    oiled too” Croemartee thinks to himself as Elroy lifts the lid begins to rummage
                                    before
                                    removing a wooden box about the size of a small knapsack. Elroy apologizes and moves
                                    towards the kitchen. Even with him trying to hide the box Croemartee noticing signs
                                    of
                                    hidden compartments, and the mechanisms for unlocking them, on the box as it passes.
                                    Alone, for the moment, he dips his pen and sketches the trunk and box before taking
                                    a
                                    few quick notes: about dozen missing; at least 40 years; mist tied to special
                                    inconsistent patterns; local lore ingrained; no returnees, but something has.
                                    Croemartee
                                    lifts the nib and considered for a moment before Elroy reenters holding a small bag,
                                    just a bit larger than a potion of healing, by a drawstring.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Elroy gently lowers the bag onto the table before sitting and eyeing Croemartee
                                    again.
                                    This guest was an odd one for sure. His gaunt face, with cheek bones almost
                                    protruding,
                                    and eyes, giving the impression that they were sunken to the point where one might
                                    assume he was dead. For that matter it almost made Elroy feel that he was sitting
                                    with a
                                    corpse. Still, there was something about the strangeness that made sharing the
                                    object
                                    feel good, no, Elroy correct to himself, alright. Only alright.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;This was found by my grandfather&quot; Elroy expresses in a loud whisper as if
                                    he's both trying to let Croemartee hear him but also make sure no one can. With a
                                    slight
                                    tremor in his hands Elroy begins to undo the drawstring &quot;I was told he found it
                                    just sitting on the ground in the middle of the land after the mists came in. He
                                    assumed
                                    it must have just washed up there. He never liked talking about it but&quot; he
                                    pulls
                                    back the bag &quot;I was told it moved a bit&quot; a hollow thunk as a dried human
                                    hand
                                    severed just above the wrist hits the table. It's skin a deep grey color, the life
                                    long
                                    drained from it, except for a spiraling design painted or maybe tattooed on it in
                                    the
                                    center. Three strands wrapping out from a central point with a circular motion. Each
                                    strand, equidistant from one another, curving slightly forward before swinging the
                                    other
                                    one way and finishing with the tips curving completely over, in the original
                                    direction,
                                    and in on itself.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Elroy averts his eyes but Croemartee leans in mouthing &quot;fascinating&quot; to
                                    himself. He feels the power behind the yellow pattern reach into his mind as if the
                                    tendrils were rising off the flesh and extending themselves in an attempt to wriggle
                                    behind his eyes and then deeper still. &quot;No no, I haven't given you any such
                                    permission and I don't intend to. Now sit still while I do my analysis&quot; he

                                    to himself as he reaches into his bag, lifts out a book, and flips it open. The tome
                                    with it's soft worn black leather, an embossed pattern his friend Nero once made,
                                    now
                                    only barely visible, and it's pages and pages of hand written notes which he flips
                                    through rapidly looking for the correct solution. Finding the specific page he
                                    begins
                                    mumbling to himself and gesturing with his free hand. His concentration unwavering
                                    as
                                    Janet enters to announce &quot;the food will be” before stopping herself mid

                                    watch. Finally he places the tome down and, with his newly freed hand, plucks a
                                    white
                                    feather and pearl from his bag continuing with his mumbling and gestures. Finishing
                                    Croemartee lifts the pearl, in the open palm of his left hand, and lowers the
                                    feather
                                    with his right to touch the ocher symbol. The moment they make contact both the

                                    &quot;Very interesting&quot; Croemartee finally announces brushing the dust off his
                                    hands. &quot;Thank you so much for the hospitality! I really wish I could stay for
                                    the
                                    meal but I must be on my way. Elroy, please put that away. It's a ghastly thing and
                                    I
                                    wouldn't recommend having it out when the mists come in.&quot; Elroy stares, wide
                                    eyed,
                                    for a moment, and, snapping back to awareness, begins to hastily place the hand back
                                    in
                                    it's bag and with Janet’s help returns it to it’s box and then the trunk.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;You’re leaving, but the mist is coming in? You said it yourself&quot; Janet
                                    questions as she turns back from the trunk and makes her way back to the cacophony
                                    emanating from the kitchen &quot;and didn't Elroy just finish explaining how folks
                                    don't
                                    tend to fair so well out there with the mists and tides?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Correct you are Janet but my research simple demands it. I do hope you'll both
                                    wish me the best of luck and not worry too much&quot; and without waiting for a
                                    response
                                    Croemartee stand, lifting his bag, turning in a single motion, and walks straight to
                                    the
                                    door. As he swings it open, his spare hand rises, lifted the hood of his robe and,
                                    with
                                    a smile and nod at the couple, he exits, closing the door politely behind him.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The wind begin to carry a frigid character, that very specific kind that one can
                                    only
                                    find at the precipice of the oceans. The mist was already rather thick and
                                    Croemartee
                                    had no time to spare. He quickly marched down the lighthouse path. The grassy hill
                                    quickly turning to large rocks, smaller ones, pebbles, and finally just dirt and
                                    bare
                                    rock. He identified the easiest path and began walking as the mist thickened keeping
                                    his
                                    ears perked up for the sound of waves that might rush towards him. &quot;Probably
                                    should

                                    before he vanished from the stretch between the lighthouse and the beaches east of
                                    Alcern.

                                    &quot;Legend has it that once upon a time a small clan of sorcerers studied their
                                    esoteric
                                    magic far out of site from society on the eastern coasts of Centrium. A young person
                                    among
                                    them broke away from their traditional practices and began to take notes, research,
                                    and,
                                    putting ink to paper, began and, rather quickly, began expanding their clans ancient
                                    magic.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Rapidly their form surpassed each of their peers, then the adults, elders, and
                                    even
                                    those of legend from before their time. Taking a nascent wild magic form and
                                    reaching
                                    the
                                    territory of even exceptional druids. They learned to grow plants from barren soil
                                    and
                                    cull
                                    whole forests with a twist of the wrist but no matter how they tried his fellows
                                    couldn't
                                    comprehend the techniques and form. It wouldn't be long after their tenth birthday
                                    that
                                    the
                                    young person would leave his home behind and begin to wander the land seeking out
                                    new
                                    means
                                    to extend the powers they had acquired.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;During this journey this scholarly sorcerer would come to discover that
                                    certain
                                    plants
                                    brought them a special excitement. With their vibrant colors, delicate forms,
                                    sometimes
                                    hidden murderous intent, but above all else simple beautiful for the sake of it.
                                    They
                                    fell
                                    in love with these flowers. Over the years, they would slowly forget the other
                                    plants
                                    and
                                    only think of flowers. Their power, unnoticed by them, sapping the life of all but
                                    the
                                    awe-inspiring blooms and passing the energy within along to gorgeous blossoms.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;They would learn to intertwine these plants of choice with themselves. Slowly
                                    over
                                    time, though no one knows how long it took, each limb, organ, even every hair
                                    follicle
                                    was
                                    replaced with one of their beloved flowers. Somehow unknowingly their humanity had
                                    been
                                    shed
                                    and their form changed. They simply realized one sunrise that they were different.
                                    They
                                    did
                                    not mind or ponder what that difference was. They simply continued wandering looking
                                    for
                                    the
                                    next beautiful flower.&quot;

                                    The old bartender coughs and drops the lofty tone he’d been using as he told his
                                    tale. &quot;So the story goes at least&quot; he announces to a rapt audience before
                                    continuing &quot;some say they are still out there. A sorcerer made of nothing but
                                    flowers
                                    that’ll steal your life by just being near.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Another patron calls out over the crowd with a few drinks behind their voice &quot;I
                                    heard
                                    they are out there still looking for some special flower&quot; concluding with a
                                    snicker. &quot;Indeed,&quot; the bartender retorts. &quot;That’s one version.
                                    Another is
                                    they lost their soul and are now just a wandering plant. Others say they are still
                                    trying to
                                    complete the spell their clan had been working on for all those generations. Still
                                    another
                                    says they are a god of flowers or the variant of that one that they are a
                                    counterbalance
                                    to
                                    some cosmic evil plant.&quot; The last few possibilities blanket the room in
                                    silence.
                                    Rumors
                                    of the destruction of Aldermoure remain unconfirmed but nonetheless word of a giant
                                    vine
                                    topped by a huge toothed flower have made their way around, even if preposterous and
                                    lacking

                                    &quot;Whatever you want to believe. Fact is, I’ve never heard a single first-hand
                                    account of
                                    this. It’s all from my Greatgrandad or maybe it was my greatgreatgrandma. Point

                                    just an old tale and&quot; he raises his voice before announcing &quot;I’m sure it

                                    nothing to do with these nonsense tales about Aldermoure.&quot;

                                    &quot;They aren’t rumors&quot; a feminine voice quivers. A slender woman sitting in
                                    the
                                    corner, seemingly uninterested in the stories of the old bartender till now, a drink
                                    in
                                    front of her, untouched. The bar sits frozen waiting until, after a long pause, she
                                    continues.  &quot;I don’t know about this Flower Sorcerer but Aldermoure is in ruin.
                                    The
                                    monstrous flower is real and the destruction it brought
                                    devastating.&quot; Unsteadily,
                                    the
                                    figure stands, a shadow moving from behind the flagon as she does. Her hands move,
                                    blocking
                                    view of the movement, and she cups her hands further hiding whatever it might have
                                    been
                                    from
                                    sight. Stumbling at first, she makes her way towards the door and, before stepping
                                    outside,
                                    she turns back, hands still cupped in front of her, and, facing the room of patrons
                                    announces &quot;I only hope this Flower Sorcerer is real because if not the Flower
                                    of
                                    Madness may be the end of us all.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    They watch her figure pivot and hear the door slam shut behind her but none move as
                                    the
                                    words sink in. The fear of what might come crawls up their spines like a vine
                                    climbing
                                    the
                                    side of a building. Slowly but surely until it's unable to dislodge. Some that night
                                    will
                                    drink in an attempt to wash away the woman's words. Others will simply accept the
                                    solemn
                                    proclamation. Whatever the patrons that evening did the next morning came with the
                                    arrival
                                    of the first refugees and tales of strange bark-carapace covered monstrosities,
                                    vines
                                    tipped
                                    in sharp barbs slashing at people, and other's with eyes that brought those who
                                    looked
                                    into
                                    them to their knees. The horrors they'd seen were real each retelling the same
                                    tales.
                                    Some
                                    went farther, speaking of the massive toothed flower rising above the church's
                                    steeple.
                                    While a few of the later arrivals spoke of heroes who faced the monstrosities and,
                                    maybe,
                                    succeeded in weakening it no one believed the horrors were over.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    For those who sat in the pub that evening the woman's words would come back to them
                                    time
                                    and
                                    again. &quot;I only hope this Flower Sorcerer is real.&quot;
