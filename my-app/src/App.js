                                    &quot;I don't know what to tell you&quot; the gruff voice moans with
                                    annoyance &quot;the
                                    mist comes in and I stay inside doing my job.&quot; Elroy lifts his forehead from an
                                    open palm hand shaking it softly and looks at his guest quizzically pondering
                                    aloud &quot;why would you want to know about the mist anyways? It's just mist.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Oh come now Honey, they are only being inquisitive&quot; a voice calls out
                                    with a
                                    touch of sweet mockery only to be followed by the man's wife entering with a pot of
                                    tea
                                    and two cups. “Elroy can be a bit grumpy when he knows a storm is coming in. Don’t
                                    mind
                                    it, he's sweet in the center.&quot; She winks at the guest and gives Elroy a little
                                    peck
                                    before whispering &quot;already put the honey in your cup&quot; and exiting with a
                                    coy
                                    giggle. Elroy looks back only catching a glimpse of Janet before she vanishes around
                                    the
                                    corner. He sighs heavily before pouring himself and his guest the tea. Taking a long
                                    sip
                                    he looks across the table &quot;tell me again Croemartee what's your interest in the
                                    mists.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The gentleman reaches down and with a long pale fingers delicately lifts the tea cup
                                    to
                                    take a sip. He smiles and with a voice that carries an air of scholarly training
                                    answers &quot;I've been studying historical records and believe these mists to be”
                                    he
                                    lapses for a moment looking for the right word before finishing with “too
                                    consistent.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Alright, but what does that mean?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;I do not know but I'd like to. It's why I'm here after all&quot; Croemartee
                                    says
                                    raising and spreading his hands in front of him like a blooming flower hiding a
                                    secret
                                    within. His fine robe's sleeves brush the table as he moves almost knocking over the
                                    tea
                                    cup. Elroy finds it odd that a robe of such fine material, with decorative
                                    embroidery
                                    along the seams too, would be so oversized but his guests frame is so slight that
                                    the
                                    robe still looks as it it will swallow him whole like a dragon turtle to a sailor
                                    caught
                                    in its maw.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Well lad here's what I can say. I'd never come or go during the fog. Too
                                    dangerous
                                    first off. Can't see if and where the waters come in. Go for a walk and might end up
                                    swept away. After all, the land between here and the mainland isn't big, you know it
                                    yourself having walked here, but give it some hours and parts of it will start to
                                    vanish
                                    as the tides change. For that matter I wouldn't leave even if it was safe
                                    because&quot; he puffs up his chest as if preparing to below a grand exultation only
                                    to
                                    be cut off by Janet, again from the kitchen &quot;because you’re the fourth
                                    generation
                                    lighthouse keeper, right Honey?&quot; She peeks around the corner flashing a smile
                                    and
                                    finishing &quot;It's your duty after all to make sure that all ships make it safely
                                    into
                                    the harbor of Alcern! If it wasn't for this lighthouse how could the great merchants
                                    of
                                    this fair city ever hope to do business.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Yes, Sweetheart, that is, indeed, what I was going to say&quot; he lets out
                                    with a
                                    bit of exasperation again watching Janet disappear back to her sizzling pans just
                                    barely
                                    audible from the table. &quot;With that all said, I've had folks leave here, only
                                    two
                                    mind you, one when I was a mere child and once when I when I was a young man.
                                    Neither
                                    made it back to the mainland. My father said that they both must have been hit by a
                                    wave
                                    and swept away. Beyond that I've heard that a half dozen or so have tried to reach
                                    the
                                    lighthouse when the mists are out and also gone missing but that's more a story to
                                    scare
                                    children than fact by any account I've been able to find.&quot;
                                    Croemartee drums his fingers softness as he watches the smile change to that
                                    pondering
                                    smile creeping across his face as Elroy goes on with his account. He waits a moment,
                                    letting Elroy shift uncomfortably in the near silence, broken by the sound of a
                                    boiling
                                    pot of water that has just joined the orchestra of kitchen work in the
                                    background. &quot;So things go missing in the mist. Seems normal by all accounts and
                                    rather logical given the tidal patterns that have been recorded to accompany them.”
                                    Croemartee’s fingers stop and, lifting his hands tighter, leans forward a bit. “So
                                    things go missing, but you haven't mentioned if anything ever comes
                                    out.&quot; Elroy's
                                    complexion shifts from its usual politely red tone to something more in line with
                                    the
                                    pale complexion Croemartee wears. Elroy watches his guest’s smile twists up at the
                                    corners and wonders if their eyes, like those of the orange cat that wanders the
                                    island,
                                    will narrow, as the feline’s do in the moment when prey comes into sight. &quot;Come
                                    now, Elroy” Croemartee continues making the implied question a reality. “What has
                                    the
                                    mist given us?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Elroy lifts himself warily and steps around his guest to a large trunk in the
                                    corner.
                                    Well cared for, the old studded leather appears finely crafted. “It was clearly well
                                    loved and taken care of over what must have been at least a few generations. Oh and
                                    well
                                    oiled too” Croemartee thinks to himself as Elroy lifts the lid begins to rummage
                                    before
                                    removing a wooden box about the size of a small knapsack. Elroy apologizes and moves
                                    towards the kitchen. Even with him trying to hide the box Croemartee noticing signs
                                    of
                                    hidden compartments, and the mechanisms for unlocking them, on the box as it passes.
                                    Alone, for the moment, he dips his pen and sketches the trunk and box before taking
                                    a
                                    few quick notes: about dozen missing; at least 40 years; mist tied to special
                                    inconsistent patterns; local lore ingrained; no returnees, but something has.
                                    Croemartee
                                    lifts the nib and considered for a moment before Elroy reenters holding a small bag,
                                    just a bit larger than a potion of healing, by a drawstring.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Elroy gently lowers the bag onto the table before sitting and eyeing Croemartee
                                    again.
                                    This guest was an odd one for sure. His gaunt face, with cheek bones almost
                                    protruding,
                                    and eyes, giving the impression that they were sunken to the point where one might
                                    assume he was dead. For that matter it almost made Elroy feel that he was sitting
                                    with a
                                    corpse. Still, there was something about the strangeness that made sharing the
                                    object
                                    feel good, no, Elroy correct to himself, alright. Only alright.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;This was found by my grandfather&quot; Elroy expresses in a loud whisper as if
                                    he's both trying to let Croemartee hear him but also make sure no one can. With a
                                    slight
                                    tremor in his hands Elroy begins to undo the drawstring &quot;I was told he found it
                                    just sitting on the ground in the middle of the land after the mists came in. He
                                    assumed
                                    it must have just washed up there. He never liked talking about it but&quot; he
                                    pulls
                                    back the bag &quot;I was told it moved a bit&quot; a hollow thunk as a dried human
                                    hand
                                    severed just above the wrist hits the table. It's skin a deep grey color, the life
                                    long
                                    drained from it, except for a spiraling design painted or maybe tattooed on it in
                                    the
                                    center. Three strands wrapping out from a central point with a circular motion. Each
                                    strand, equidistant from one another, curving slightly forward before swinging the
                                    other
                                    one way and finishing with the tips curving completely over, in the original
                                    direction,
                                    and in on itself.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Elroy averts his eyes but Croemartee leans in mouthing &quot;fascinating&quot; to
                                    himself. He feels the power behind the yellow pattern reach into his mind as if the
                                    tendrils were rising off the flesh and extending themselves in an attempt to wriggle
                                    behind his eyes and then deeper still. &quot;No no, I haven't given you any such
                                    permission and I don't intend to. Now sit still while I do my analysis&quot; he

                                    to himself as he reaches into his bag, lifts out a book, and flips it open. The tome
                                    with it's soft worn black leather, an embossed pattern his friend Nero once made,
                                    now
                                    only barely visible, and it's pages and pages of hand written notes which he flips
                                    through rapidly looking for the correct solution. Finding the specific page he
                                    begins
                                    mumbling to himself and gesturing with his free hand. His concentration unwavering
                                    as
                                    Janet enters to announce &quot;the food will be” before stopping herself mid

                                    watch. Finally he places the tome down and, with his newly freed hand, plucks a
                                    white
                                    feather and pearl from his bag continuing with his mumbling and gestures. Finishing
                                    Croemartee lifts the pearl, in the open palm of his left hand, and lowers the
                                    feather
                                    with his right to touch the ocher symbol. The moment they make contact both the

                                    &quot;Very interesting&quot; Croemartee finally announces brushing the dust off his
                                    hands. &quot;Thank you so much for the hospitality! I really wish I could stay for
                                    the
                                    meal but I must be on my way. Elroy, please put that away. It's a ghastly thing and
                                    I
                                    wouldn't recommend having it out when the mists come in.&quot; Elroy stares, wide
                                    eyed,
                                    for a moment, and, snapping back to awareness, begins to hastily place the hand back
                                    in
                                    it's bag and with Janet’s help returns it to it’s box and then the trunk.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;You’re leaving, but the mist is coming in? You said it yourself&quot; Janet
                                    questions as she turns back from the trunk and makes her way back to the cacophony
                                    emanating from the kitchen &quot;and didn't Elroy just finish explaining how folks
                                    don't
                                    tend to fair so well out there with the mists and tides?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Correct you are Janet but my research simple demands it. I do hope you'll both
                                    wish me the best of luck and not worry too much&quot; and without waiting for a
                                    response
                                    Croemartee stand, lifting his bag, turning in a single motion, and walks straight to
                                    the
                                    door. As he swings it open, his spare hand rises, lifted the hood of his robe and,
                                    with
                                    a smile and nod at the couple, he exits, closing the door politely behind him.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The wind begin to carry a frigid character, that very specific kind that one can
                                    only
                                    find at the precipice of the oceans. The mist was already rather thick and
                                    Croemartee
                                    had no time to spare. He quickly marched down the lighthouse path. The grassy hill
                                    quickly turning to large rocks, smaller ones, pebbles, and finally just dirt and
                                    bare
                                    rock. He identified the easiest path and began walking as the mist thickened keeping
                                    his
                                    ears perked up for the sound of waves that might rush towards him. &quot;Probably
                                    should

                                    before he vanished from the stretch between the lighthouse and the beaches east of
                                    Alcern.

                                    &quot;Legend has it that once upon a time a small clan of sorcerers studied their
                                    esoteric
                                    magic far out of site from society on the eastern coasts of Centrium. A young person
                                    among
                                    them broke away from their traditional practices and began to take notes, research,
                                    and,
                                    putting ink to paper, began and, rather quickly, began expanding their clans ancient
                                    magic.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Rapidly their form surpassed each of their peers, then the adults, elders, and
                                    even
                                    those of legend from before their time. Taking a nascent wild magic form and
                                    reaching
                                    the
                                    territory of even exceptional druids. They learned to grow plants from barren soil
                                    and
                                    cull
                                    whole forests with a twist of the wrist but no matter how they tried his fellows
                                    couldn't
                                    comprehend the techniques and form. It wouldn't be long after their tenth birthday
                                    that
                                    the
                                    young person would leave his home behind and begin to wander the land seeking out
                                    new
                                    means
                                    to extend the powers they had acquired.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;During this journey this scholarly sorcerer would come to discover that
                                    certain
                                    plants
                                    brought them a special excitement. With their vibrant colors, delicate forms,
                                    sometimes
                                    hidden murderous intent, but above all else simple beautiful for the sake of it.
                                    They
                                    fell
                                    in love with these flowers. Over the years, they would slowly forget the other
                                    plants
                                    and
                                    only think of flowers. Their power, unnoticed by them, sapping the life of all but
                                    the
                                    awe-inspiring blooms and passing the energy within along to gorgeous blossoms.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;They would learn to intertwine these plants of choice with themselves. Slowly
                                    over
                                    time, though no one knows how long it took, each limb, organ, even every hair
                                    follicle
                                    was
                                    replaced with one of their beloved flowers. Somehow unknowingly their humanity had
                                    been
                                    shed
                                    and their form changed. They simply realized one sunrise that they were different.
                                    They
                                    did
                                    not mind or ponder what that difference was. They simply continued wandering looking
                                    for
                                    the
                                    next beautiful flower.&quot;

                                    The old bartender coughs and drops the lofty tone he’d been using as he told his
                                    tale. &quot;So the story goes at least&quot; he announces to a rapt audience before
                                    continuing &quot;some say they are still out there. A sorcerer made of nothing but
                                    flowers
                                    that’ll steal your life by just being near.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Another patron calls out over the crowd with a few drinks behind their voice &quot;I
                                    heard
                                    they are out there still looking for some special flower&quot; concluding with a
                                    snicker. &quot;Indeed,&quot; the bartender retorts. &quot;That’s one version.
                                    Another is
                                    they lost their soul and are now just a wandering plant. Others say they are still
                                    trying to
                                    complete the spell their clan had been working on for all those generations. Still
                                    another
                                    says they are a god of flowers or the variant of that one that they are a
                                    counterbalance
                                    to
                                    some cosmic evil plant.&quot; The last few possibilities blanket the room in
                                    silence.
                                    Rumors
                                    of the destruction of Aldermoure remain unconfirmed but nonetheless word of a giant
                                    vine
                                    topped by a huge toothed flower have made their way around, even if preposterous and
                                    lacking

                                    &quot;Whatever you want to believe. Fact is, I’ve never heard a single first-hand
                                    account of
                                    this. It’s all from my Greatgrandad or maybe it was my greatgreatgrandma. Point

                                    just an old tale and&quot; he raises his voice before announcing &quot;I’m sure it

                                    nothing to do with these nonsense tales about Aldermoure.&quot;

                                    &quot;They aren’t rumors&quot; a feminine voice quivers. A slender woman sitting in
                                    the
                                    corner, seemingly uninterested in the stories of the old bartender till now, a drink
                                    in
                                    front of her, untouched. The bar sits frozen waiting until, after a long pause, she
                                    continues.  &quot;I don’t know about this Flower Sorcerer but Aldermoure is in ruin.
                                    The
                                    monstrous flower is real and the destruction it brought
                                    devastating.&quot; Unsteadily,
                                    the
                                    figure stands, a shadow moving from behind the flagon as she does. Her hands move,

                                    view of the movement, and she cups her hands further hiding whatever it might have
                                    been
                                    from
                                    sight. Stumbling at first, she makes her way towards the door and, before stepping
                                    outside,
                                    she turns back, hands still cupped in front of her, and, facing the room of patrons
                                    announces &quot;I only hope this Flower Sorcerer is real because if not the Flower
                                    of
                                    Madness may be the end of us all.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    They watch her figure pivot and hear the door slam shut behind her but none move as
                                    the
                                    words sink in. The fear of what might come crawls up their spines like a vine
                                    climbing
                                    the
                                    side of a building. Slowly but surely until it's unable to dislodge. Some that night
                                    will
                                    drink in an attempt to wash away the woman's words. Others will simply accept the
                                    solemn
                                    proclamation. Whatever the patrons that evening did the next morning came with the
                                    arrival
                                    of the first refugees and tales of strange bark-carapace covered monstrosities,
                                    vines
                                    tipped
                                    in sharp barbs slashing at people, and other's with eyes that brought those who
                                    looked
                                    into
                                    them to their knees. The horrors they'd seen were real each retelling the same
                                    tales.
                                    Some
                                    went farther, speaking of the massive toothed flower rising above the church's
                                    steeple.
                                    While a few of the later arrivals spoke of heroes who faced the monstrosities and,
                                    maybe,
                                    succeeded in weakening it no one believed the horrors were over.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    For those who sat in the pub that evening the woman's words would come back to them
                                    time
                                    and
                                    again. &quot;I only hope this Flower Sorcerer is real.&quot;

                                I see it move, quick, darting through bushes. There, over a limb. Now, turning around
                                the tree. It tries to evade me but it can’t. I turn early, anticipating its next move
                                and force it to dodge. I’m the smarter of us through it and ends up gets caught in a
                                thick patch of young trees, each jostling the others in an attempt to reach up through
                                the thick canopy. The trees in the Hizarkian Valley grow thick after all. Reaching the
                                light is a great struggle. My prey cannot pass and as it turns to look for another
                                passage I leap into the air, drawing my staff and the shiny sword, a gift from my friend
                                Dolarn, and strike, a slash to the heel to stop it from fleeing. The beast collapses,
                                the cut leg unable to bear the weight. I land, pivot, and slam the quarterstaff into the
                                side of its head, striking true into the soft spot behind the ear. My prey wobbles for a
                                moment and then, with a loud thunk, falls over. I jump out of the way as it almost rolls
                                onto me. Looking at the giant boar I laugh heartily. &quot;Yes yes! Orthi Vepesk has
                                found a great dinner!&quot; I spend a little time tying the boar up and, finding
                                suitable bark to place under it, I begin to drag the beast back to the city of Khern.
                                It’ll be a long way I think to myself but I smile knowing how delicious the stew will be
                                after all the work. The dwarves of Khern are such good cooks after all! Though I’d
                                happily eat this as it is all the spices and cutting and ‘braising’, I think they call
                                it, does make it very very tasty.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The one watching Orthi ponders the sight they see. The light streaming through the
                                canopy leaves cause the green scales to glisten like emeralds but the blue streaks that
                                run between the scales is even stranger, not the usual patterning of a lizard folk. The
                                sight of one having hunted a giant boar alone not to mention dragging it alone uphill
                                through the forest too. Really quite the sight to see. The figure shifts from their
                                hiding spot and approaches Orthi. As they move their hulking form and blue skin begin to
                                change so that, when Orthi does see them at last, she only see’s an old human woman in
                                simple cloths walking towards her.
                                <br/><br/>
                                &quot;Hello! Who are you&quot; Orthi announces quizzically dropping the ropes and
                                walking over to the old lady.
                                <br/><br/>
                                &quot;Oh, me? I’m Neva. I’ve been on a pilgrimage you see and I think I’m a bit lost.
                                You seem very busy but I’m very tired and could use help finding the way back to the
                                main path.&quot;
                                <br/><br/>
                                Orthi looks them over and nods. &quot;Yes, you do look old and tired. Being lost is very
                                bad too&quot; she looks around for a moment and nods again before continuing &quot;the
                                path is that way.&quot; Orthi raises a pointed white claw but pauses and tilts her head
                                to the side and announces &quot;it is a bit far, and dangerous, and a bit steep of a
                                climb. I will take you!&quot; The old woman’s eyes widen as she takes in the strange
                                lizardfolk, or at least strange for a lizardfolk.
                                <br/><br/>
                                &quot;Oh my but what about your boar? Will you leave it behind?&quot;
                                <br/><br/>
                                Orthi laughs heartily. Leave food, she thinks to herself, what a silly old
                                lady. &quot;No no no. I just need a moment.&quot; Orthi picks a good looking tree and
                                climbs up, farther and farther, until her head pokes through the leaves. She raises
                                herself over the canopy and breaths the cool air. She feels it fill her lungs and she
                                holds it for a second before letting it go and whispering under her
                                breath &quot;come&quot;. The near cloudless sky cracks with
                                thunder. &quot;Come.&quot; Another crack, closer this time.&quot; Orthi feels it now.
                                The static in the air growing. The slight shift in the breeze. If the old woman could
                                see her she’d see the normally brown eyes of Orthi, just another lizardfolk to a lay
                                person, turn blue and sparkle. &quot;Come!&quot; Another crack and, along with it,
                                lightning strikes the tree top and Orthi.
                                <br/><br/>
                                &quot;Oh my&quot; the old woman shrieks as the treetops burst with light and the feeling
                                of the lightnings impact slams into her, the pressure of the sound enough to knock this
                                form over. &quot;What&quot; she begins to say as the lizardfolk scurries down the trunk
                                as if nothing happened. Before the old woman can say another word she feels the
                                lizardfolk lift her into their arms and watches them grab the rope in their teach and
                                lowering themselves to the ground begin running on all fours, three really given the one
                                arm being used to carry the woman. As she hangs there in the air the old woman takes in
                                the lizardfolk again seeing now those slight patterning in their scales has become a
                                vibrant blue, glowing, almost as if charged and their eyes, now a beautiful sapphire
                                like a fresh water lake.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Only the sound of the boar dragging behind them fills the air until they finally reach
                                the main road. Orthi places the old woman down and stands stretching for a moment before
                                pointing and saying &quot;this way to Khern and that way to the road to Hizark Kingdom
                                or Reyland. Be safe now, no more getting lost.&quot; Orthi grins a toothy grin, her
                                pointed teeth quite a sight.   &quot;Hehehehe&quot; the old woman laughs stepping
                                backward and raising a hand to cover her face as her limbs begin to elongate and voice
                                deepen. &quot;You are one of the more interesting fellows I’ve found in these woods over
                                the years.&quot; The skin of the creature darkens to its unnatural blue tone, its eyes
                                yellowing, and horns rising from its forehead. &quot;What is your name lizard of
                                lightning? What may I grant you for your kindness.&quot;  Orthi looks the creature over
                                and announces &quot;Oh you’re that Oni thing! I think a friend met you once! You’re very
                                blue just like the blue in my scales&quot; the joy in her voice leaving the Oni staring
                                back in confusion. &quot;Oh, uh, I didn’t answer your questions. I’m Orthi and, um, I’m
                                good but here&quot; she turns and slices a chunk out of the giant boar &quot;take this!
                                Food tastes best when shared after all.&quot; Before the Oni can overcome their
                                bafflement Orthi has already grabbed the rope and begun to run up the path, filled with
                                excitement for how much better the food will be knowing she shared it with another
                                ‘person’. The Oni watches as Orthi bolts up and out of sight the blue light trailing
                                after her just a bit. With a snicker the Oni raises their hood overhead and turns to
                                begin walking the path in the opposite direction. With a wave of their hand they begin
                                to vanish whispering as they go &quot;till we meet again Orthi, Lizard of
                                Lightning.&quot;

                                    &quot;Please, if you would be so kind, explain how this works one more time for me
                                    my good Zade?&quot; a middle-aged woman listens to the request as she plucks two
                                    books from a shelf and elegantly saunters to the couch. Plopping down across from
                                    her guest, she adjusts the layers of her long skirt, placing the two leather-bound
                                    works in front of him. &quot;Call me Shehera if you wouldn't mind,&quot; she says as
                                    she looks up at the guest and winks &quot;or Aunty Essem if you want a good
                                    time.&quot; Datris leans back a little farther in his chair and raises an eyebrow
                                    before shifting forward again, elbows on knees, a hand, palm turned down under his
                                    chin, and retorts with a conspiritorial smirk &quot;fine then. Shehera it is. I
                                    might be a fool, but I'm not foolhardy enough to walk straight into one of your
                                    little stories.&quot; Datrius runs the fingers of his free hand across the text
                                    embossed in the two works that have been placed in front of him. &quot;Two copies of
                                    the same book? Why would I need to read the same thing&quot; his eyes widen and,
                                    interrupting the audible thought, he pulls back like a child touching a hot
                                    stove &quot;which is it?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Shehera giggles &quot;oh, don’t worry, just touching the book does nothing at all.
                                    It’s the act of reading that engages my art. It would be far less satisfying of an
                                    effect otherwise. After all, it’s the fabulous story telling, the infectious
                                    diction, the way it draws forth something innate from one’s soul. That’s what leads
                                    to the magnificent outcomes after all.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Or you’ve figured out how to weave the most complex geas Val’aran, Janis, even
                                    Akelar has ever seen. For Æ’s sake it doesn't even register as magic!&quot; Shehera
                                    looks Datrius up and down. Raising his arms to the sky, he exclaims the Al'Elements
                                    name and holds the pose to emphasize his exasperation. With another chuckle she
                                    calmly answers, &quot;I did tell you. It isn't magic. Just great writing. See this
                                    book. Of the hundreds I crafted Cruel Souls only produced two copies that affect the
                                    reader, to my knowledge at least. They do have the same effect, but truly I don't
                                    know how or why. I may be able to tell when it happens, but why still alludes
                                    me.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Perfect. Then you can just stop releasing them couldn't you or destroy those
                                    copies?&quot; Datrius ponders standing and beginning to pace the small cabin. A weak
                                    attempt to put distance between himself and the book. He takes a moment, waiting for
                                    Shehera’s response, to appreciate the beauty of her home. The walls of the main room
                                    were almost entirely bookshelves carved of gorgeous lumber she must have had brought
                                    in. The collection on them was its own sight to behold, including many rare titles
                                    as well as a suspicious number of copies of Shehera’s own works which, Datrius now
                                    surmised must be those copies. Making a note to ask her another time about how the
                                    rest of the collection, and private island for that matter, came into her
                                    possession.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;It just wouldn't be right to deny the world my greatest works&quot; she
                                    exclaims following behind Datrius and laying her hand on his shoulder and leaning in
                                    to whisper &quot;I can’t destroy them. The magic hops when you do.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    What do you mean it hops? What if you destroy the last one?&quot; Datrius turns,
                                    grabbing her, and stares into her eyes, attempting however futilely to determine if
                                    this is the truth or another game. Seeing the concern in his face, she takes a
                                    breath and replies &quot;it does. Another copy becomes the enchanted one. As for
                                    destroying the last, I tried. It would burn like any book and then reappear
                                    somewhere. These books are something special, Datrius. I don’t know what else to
                                    tell you. I can’t stop writing. It’s who I am. You should understand as a
                                    storyteller yourself.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    He looks away and begrudgingly nods.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;I’m glad you can understand what I mean. Few can fully comprehend what it
                                    means to be so divinely compelled to author such tales. This isn’t just me. There’s
                                    something at work here I don’t understand, like that mist that tends to entrap the
                                    island.&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;I have been meaning to ask about that. Has the mist always been&quot; Datrius
                                    stumbles for a moment, taking a beat, and returning &quot;yes, I understand
                                    Shehera&quot; he leads them back to the couch sitting with her this time. The two
                                    look down at the book. The title: The Girl’s Monster staring back at them. &quot;I
                                    do have to ask, what does this one do?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Lackadaisical Shehera replies &quot;oh, nothing much. I think it just compels one to
                                    seek out a rush from a dangerous situation.&quot; She watches Datrius place his face
                                    in his hands, and slowly shake his head, letting out a massive sigh.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;By Æ and the Origins. I pray for whoever finds one of these. How many
                                    enchanted copies are there?&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    &quot;Oh, just one!&quot;
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Great news then, Datrius begins to think, if there’s one, and it’s here, no harm or
                                    fowl, but Shehera cuts his thought off stating &quot;only thing is, neither of these
                                    are actually it. I was just playing with you earlier.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;By the
                                    blessed Al’Element we are doomed.&quot;
